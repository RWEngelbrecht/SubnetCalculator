# SubnetCalculator
Remember when your teacher told you you won't always have a calculator, so you better learn to calculate in your head? Well...

CIDR notation helper; Subnet divisor helper; Built in Go with Cobra and Viper;

## TODO:
- start project
- add print CIDR cheatsheet-esque table
  - really just some extra --help functionality
- give network base ip, tell it how many subnets you want
  - should return subnets + subnet masks
